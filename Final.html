        <div class="myDiv"><p><center> Here is my final project that I created with my partner Colin. It is a take on the popular gambling game blackjack as both my partner and I enjoy the game and wanted to share it with all of you. To access the game simply click the image below and it will take you to the game site. To play click "Begin Game" and the game screen will appear. It is a two player game where the first player chooses whether to hit or stand and then the dealer does the same. After this you compare the two hands and whoever is closest to 21 without going over wins!</center></p></div>
